# Title
Game Save and Load Functionality

# Overview
This feature enables the creation, saving, and loading of a single game instance using a JSON format stored on the local file system. It is designed for all players to persist and resume their game progress via the API.

# Goals
- Allow users to create a new game instance via the API
- Enable saving the current game state as a JSON file on the local file system
- Enable loading a previously saved game state from the local file system via the API

# Domain details
- **Game Instance**: The current state of a game, including all relevant data needed to resume play
- **Save**: The process of serializing the game instance to a JSON file
- **Load**: The process of deserializing a JSON file to restore a game instance
- **API**: The programmatic interface through which users interact with the save/load functionality
